This folder has MATLAB files and support files to simulate different worlds filled with particles and algorithms that can converge the particles.
Below are the files and subfolder defanitions
data	- Consists .dat files that log the results of collectingByAPSPv1.m for different settings.	
blockMaps.m	- MATLAB function that is called to access small maps with map number
collectingByAPSPv1.m	- Main program that takes map umber, algorithm number as inputs to generate the number of steps and the step sequence.
